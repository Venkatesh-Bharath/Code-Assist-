## How Code Assist+ Generates Code

Code Assist+ uses Codestral's advanced language model to generate responses. When you input code or a query, the application sends a prompt to Codestral's API, which processes the input and generates a relevant response based on its training on vast amounts of code and natural language data. The response is then displayed in the application.

## Conclusion

Code Assist+ is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your coding experience. By following the instructions in this user manual, you can leverage the application's features to improve your code, learn new concepts, and collaborate with other developers. Happy coding!
