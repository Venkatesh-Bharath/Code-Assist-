## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Codestral API key (you can sign up for one on the Codestral website).
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
- Required Python libraries: Streamlit, Codestral, and FPDF.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Code Assist+ repository from GitHub.
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries using the command:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**: Replace `"****************"` in the code with your Codestral API key.

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## Using Code Assist+

### Navigation

Code Assist+ provides several features accessible via the sidebar:
- **Code Generation**
- **Code Conversion**
- **Code Review Chatbot**
- **Code Debugger**
- **Document Generation**
- **About**

Select a tab to access its features.
### Code Generation
1. **Navigate to the "Code Generation" tab**.
2. **Select the target language** (e.g., Java) from the dropdown menu.
3. **Enter your problem statement** in the text area provided.
4. **Click "Generate"** to receive the  code.

**Example**:

```markdown
# Factorial of a Number in Java

## Code

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 5; // Change this value to calculate the factorial of a different number
        long factorial = 1;
        int i = 1;
        
        while (i <= num) {
            factorial *= i;
            i++;
        }
        
        System.out.println("The factorial of " + num + " is " + factorial);
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

- **num**: Stores the number for which we calculate the factorial.
- **factorial**: Holds the result of the factorial calculation (initialized to 1).
- **i**: Counter used in the while loop to iterate from 1 up to `num`.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `num` to the desired number, `factorial` to 1, and `i` to 1.
2. **Calculation**: Multiply `factorial` by `i` in each iteration of the loop.
3. **Output**: Print the factorial of `num`.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is **O(n)**, where `n` is the value of `num`. The while loop runs `n` times.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this code is **O(1)** because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
```

This structure provides a clear breakdown of the Java code to calculate the factorial, along with explanations of its components and complexities.

```

### Code Conversion

1. **Navigate to the "Code Conversion" tab**.
2. **Enter your code** in the text area provided.
3. **Select the target language** (e.g., Java) from the dropdown menu.
4. **Click "Convert Code"** to receive the converted code.

**Example**:
```python
# Python Code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**Converted to Java**:
```java
public class Main {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### Code Review Chatbot

1. **Navigate to the "Code Review Chatbot" tab**.
2. **Enter your code** in the text area provided.
3. **Click "Send"** to receive feedback and suggestions.

**Example**:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**Response**:
"The code is simple and effective. Consider adding type hints for better readability."

### Code Debugger

1. **Navigate to the "Code Debugger" tab**.
2. **Enter your code** and **the error message** in the provided text areas.
3. **Click "Debug"** to receive a debugged version of your code.

**Example**:
```python
# Code
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

# Error Message
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Response**:
"To handle division by zero, you can add a check before performing the division:
```python
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 'Cannot divide by zero'
    return a / b
```

### Document Generation

1. **Navigate to the "Document Generation" tab**.
2. **Enter your code** in the text area provided.
3. **Click "Generate Document"** to create detailed documentation.

**Example**:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Generated Document**:
A PDF containing:
- Heading: Greeting Function
- About: This function greets the user by name.
- Code: The provided code.
- Explanation: Line-by-line explanation of the code.
- Alternative Implementations: Other ways to write the greeting function.
- Conclusion.



## How Code Assist+ Generates Code

Code Assist+ uses Codestral's advanced language model to generate responses. When you input code or a query, the application sends a prompt to Codestral's API, which processes the input and generates a relevant response based on its training on vast amounts of code and natural language data. The response is then displayed in the application.

## Conclusion

Code Assist+ is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your coding experience. By following the instructions in this user manual, you can leverage the application's features to improve your code, learn new concepts, and collaborate with other developers. Happy coding!
